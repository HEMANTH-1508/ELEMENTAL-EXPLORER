        <section>
            <h2>Introduction to P-Block Elements</h2>
            <p>The P-block elements are located in Groups 13 to 18 of the periodic table. These elements have their valence electrons in the p-orbital, which can hold a maximum of six electrons. The P-block includes a diverse range of elements, such as non-metals, metalloids, and metals, with varying chemical and physical properties.</p>
