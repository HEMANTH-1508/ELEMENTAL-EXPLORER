            <h2>Introduction to S-Block Elements</h2>
            <p>The S-block elements are the elements in Group 1 and Group 2 of the periodic table, plus Hydrogen and Helium. These elements have their valence electrons in the s-orbital, and they are known for their high reactivity, especially the alkali metals (Group 1) and alkaline earth metals (Group 2).</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Characteristics of S-Block Elements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Alkali Metals (Group 1):</strong> These are highly reactive metals, especially with water, and they have a single valence electron in their s-orbital.</li>
                <li><strong>Alkaline Earth Metals (Group 2):</strong> Less reactive than alkali metals but still quite reactive. They have two valence electrons in their s-orbital.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydrogen:</strong> While placed in Group 1, hydrogen is a non-metal with unique properties, including its ability to form both ionic and covalent bonds.</li>
                <li><strong>Helium:</strong> A noble gas, but it is placed in Group 18, although it has its valence electron in the s-orbital.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Section: Electron Configuration -->
        <section>
            <h2>Electron Configuration of S-Block Elements</h2>
            <p>S-block elements have their valence electrons in the s-orbital. The general electron configuration for the S-block elements is:</p>
            <pre>ns^1 (Group 1 - Alkali Metals)</pre>
            <pre>ns^2 (Group 2 - Alkaline Earth Metals)</pre>
            <p>Where "n" refers to the principal quantum number, indicating the energy level of the electron.</p>

        <!-- Section: Alkali Metals -->
        <section>
            <h2>Alkali Metals (Group 1)</h2>
            <p>The alkali metals are highly reactive metals, characterized by their single valence electron in the s-orbital. They are soft, have low melting points, and are good conductors of heat and electricity. Examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lithium (Li):</strong> The lightest metal, known for its use in batteries.</li>
                <li><strong>Sodium (Na):</strong> Commonly found in table salt.</li>
                <li><strong>Potassium (K):</strong> Important for nerve function in animals.</li>
                <li><strong>Rubidium (Rb):</strong> Used in research applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Cesium (Cs):</strong> Used in atomic clocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Francium (Fr):</strong> A highly radioactive element, very rare in nature.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Section: Alkaline Earth Metals -->
        <section>
            <h2>Alkaline Earth Metals (Group 2)</h2>
            <p>The alkaline earth metals are somewhat less reactive than alkali metals but are still reactive, especially with water. They have two electrons in their s-orbital. Examples include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Beryllium (Be):</strong> Known for its use in aerospace applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Magnesium (Mg):</strong> Used in the manufacturing of lightweight materials.</li>
                <li><strong>Calcium (Ca):</strong> Vital for bone health and found in limestone.</li>
                <li><strong>Strontium (Sr):</strong> Known for its use in fireworks.</li>
                <li><strong>Barium (Ba):</strong> Used in medical imaging and fireworks.</li>
