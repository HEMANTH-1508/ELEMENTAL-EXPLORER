        <!-- Section: General Information -->
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction to F-Block Elements</h2>
            <p>The F-block elements, also known as the **inner transition metals**, consist of the **Lanthanides** and **Actinides**. These elements are placed separately at the bottom of the periodic table to maintain its structure. F-block elements have their valence electrons in the f-orbital, which contributes to their unique properties such as variable oxidation states and the ability to form colored ions.</p>

        <!-- Section: Electron Configuration -->
        <section>
            <h2>Electron Configuration of F-Block Elements</h2>
            <p>The general electron configuration for F-block elements is:</p>
