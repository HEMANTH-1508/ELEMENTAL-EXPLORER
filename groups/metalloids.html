        <h1>Metalloids</h1>
        <p>Metalloids are elements that exhibit properties intermediate between metals and nonmetals. They are also known as semimetals and can behave like conductors or insulators depending on the conditions. The metalloids include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Boron (B)</b></li>
            <li><b>Silicon (Si)</b></li>
            <li><b>Germanium (Ge)</b></li>
            <li><b>Arsenic (As)</b></li>
            <li><b>Antimony (Sb)</b></li>
            <li><b>Tellurium (Te)</b></li>
            <li><b>Polonium (Po)</b></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Characteristics of Metalloids</h2>
        <p>Metalloids have the following characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Exhibit properties of both metals and nonmetals.</li>
            <li>Can act as semiconductors, making them useful in electronics and technology.</li>
            <li>Have a metallic appearance but are brittle like nonmetals.</li>
            <li>Can form alloys with metals and often used in creating semiconductors and transistors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Role in Electronics</h2>
        <p>Metalloids like **Silicon (Si)** and **Germanium (Ge)** are essential in the field of electronics because of their semiconducting properties. They are used to manufacture transistors, integrated circuits, and other components of electronic devices.</p>

        <h2>Applications of Metalloids</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Boron:</b> Used in glassmaking, fiberglass, and as a flame retardant.</li>
            <li><b>Silicon:</b> Widely used in the production of semiconductors, solar cells, and computer chips.</li>
            <li><b>Germanium:</b> Used in fiber optics, infrared optics, and as a semiconductor.</li>
            <li><b>Arsenic:</b> Used in pesticides, wood preservatives, and in semiconductors.</li>
            <li><b>Antimony:</b> Used in flame retardants and lead alloys.</li>
            <li><b>Tellurium:</b> Used in thermoelectric devices and solar panels.</li>
            <li><b>Polonium:</b> Used in nuclear reactors and as an alpha particle source.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Silicon is the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust, after oxygen.</li>
            <li>Arsenic has been historically used as a poison, and it is highly toxic in its pure form.</li>
            <li>Polonium, a radioactive element, was famously used to poison former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko.</li>
        </ul>
