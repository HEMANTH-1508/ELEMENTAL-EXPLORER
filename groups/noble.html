        <h1>Noble Gases</h1>
        <p>The noble gases are a group of elements found in **Group 18** of the periodic table. These gases are known for their chemical inertness, meaning they do not easily form compounds with other elements. The noble gases include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Helium (He)</b></li>
            <li><b>Neon (Ne)</b></li>
            <li><b>Argon (Ar)</b></li>
            <li><b>Krypton (Kr)</b></li>
            <li><b>Xenon (Xe)</b></li>
            <li><b>Radon (Rn)</b></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Characteristics of Noble Gases</h2>
        <p>The noble gases have the following distinctive characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inert, nonreactive, and have a full outer electron shell.</li>
            <li>Colorless, odorless, and tasteless gases at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Very low chemical reactivity due to their stable electron configuration.</li>
            <li>Do not readily form compounds with other elements, though certain conditions can cause them to react.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications of Noble Gases</h2>
        <p>Despite their lack of reactivity, noble gases have a wide range of applications, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Helium:</b> Used in balloons, cryogenics, and as a cooling medium in MRI machines.</li>
            <li><b>Neon:</b> Used in neon signs, high-voltage indicators, and as a cryogenic refrigerant.</li>
            <li><b>Argon:</b> Used in welding, in light bulbs, and as an inert atmosphere for chemical processes.</li>
            <li><b>Krypton:</b> Used in high-performance light bulbs and some types of photography lighting.</li>
            <li><b>Xenon:</b> Used in light sources, such as flash lamps, and in anesthesia.</li>
            <li><b>Radon:</b> A radioactive gas used in cancer treatment, though it is generally considered hazardous due to its radioactivity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Helium is the second most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen, and is found in stars.</li>
            <li>Neon signs are commonly used for advertising, due to their bright, vibrant glow.</li>
            <li>Argon is the third most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere, after nitrogen and oxygen.</li>
        </ul>
