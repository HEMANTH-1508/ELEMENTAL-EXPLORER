        <h1>Non-Metals</h1>
        <p>Non-metals are elements that generally lack the properties of metals. They are poor conductors of heat and electricity and are typically brittle in solid form. Non-metals include both gases and solids, and they tend to have higher electronegativity compared to metals. The non-metals include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Hydrogen (H)</b></li>
            <li><b>Carbon (C)</b></li>
            <li><b>Nitrogen (N)</b></li>
            <li><b>Oxygen (O)</b></li>
            <li><b>Fluorine (F)</b></li>
            <li><b>Chlorine (Cl)</b></li>
            <li><b>Bromine (Br)</b></li>
            <li><b>Iodine (I)</b></li>
            <li><b>Phosphorus (P)</b></li>
            <li><b>Sulfur (S)</b></li>
            <li><b>Selenium (Se)</b></li>
            <li><b>Argon (Ar)</b></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Characteristics of Non-Metals</h2>
        <p>Non-metals exhibit the following properties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Good insulators (poor conductors of heat and electricity).</li>
            <li>Brittle in solid form and cannot be hammered into sheets or drawn into wires.</li>
            <li>Have high electronegativity values, meaning they tend to attract electrons in chemical reactions.</li>
            <li>Non-metals form acidic oxides that dissolve in water to form acids.</li>
            <li>They have low melting and boiling points compared to metals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications of Non-Metals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Hydrogen:</b> Used in fuel cells, hydrogenation of oils, and as rocket fuel.</li>
            <li><b>Carbon:</b> Essential in all life forms, used in steel manufacturing, and as a source of energy in the form of coal, oil, and natural gas.</li>
            <li><b>Nitrogen:</b> Used in fertilizers, explosives, and in the production of ammonia.</li>
            <li><b>Oxygen:</b> Essential for respiration, used in medical applications and in steel manufacturing.</li>
            <li><b>Fluorine:</b> Used in the production of Teflon, and in toothpaste as a fluoride compound.</li>
            <li><b>Chlorine:</b> Used in disinfectants, PVC production, and in bleach.</li>
            <li><b>Sulfur:</b> Used in the production of sulfuric acid, fertilizers, and in the vulcanization of rubber.</li>
            <li><b>Iodine:</b> Used in medical disinfectants, in iodine salts, and in the production of certain dyes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Oxygen makes up about 21% of the Earth's atmosphere and is vital for respiration in humans and animals.</li>
            <li>Carbon is found in all living organisms and is a key component of organic molecules.</li>
            <li>Chlorine is widely used as a disinfectant, particularly in swimming pools and drinking water treatment.</li>
        </ul>
