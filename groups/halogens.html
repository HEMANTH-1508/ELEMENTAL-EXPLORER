        <h1>Halogens</h1>
        <p>The halogens are a group of elements found in **Group 17** of the periodic table. They are highly reactive and tend to form salts when combined with metals. The halogens include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Fluorine (F)</b></li>
            <li><b>Chlorine (Cl)</b></li>
            <li><b>Bromine (Br)</b></li>
            <li><b>Iodine (I)</b></li>
            <li><b>Astatine (At)</b></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Characteristics of Halogens</h2>
        <p>Halogens are known for the following characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Highly reactive, especially with alkali and alkaline earth metals.</li>
            <li>Form diatomic molecules in their elemental form (e.g., Cl<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>).</li>
            <li>Have high electronegativity and tend to gain one electron to form anions.</li>
            <li>Nonmetals with varying physical states: Fluorine and Chlorine are gases, Bromine is a liquid, and Iodine and Astatine are solids at room temperature.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reactivity of Halogens</h2>
        <p>Halogens are highly reactive due to their desire to fill their outer electron shell by gaining one electron. For example:</p>
        <pre>Cl<sub>2</sub> + 2 Na â†’ 2 NaCl</pre>
        <p>This reaction shows the formation of **sodium chloride (NaCl)** when chlorine reacts with sodium metal.</p>

        <h2>Applications of Halogens</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Fluorine:</b> Used in toothpaste, water fluoridation, and in the production of Teflon.</li>
            <li><b>Chlorine:</b> Used in disinfectants, the production of PVC plastics, and for water treatment.</li>
            <li><b>Bromine:</b> Used in flame retardants, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals.</li>
            <li><b>Iodine:</b> Used in medical disinfectants, iodine tinctures, and for thyroid health.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Environmental and Health Impact</h2>
        <p>While halogens are useful, they can also have harmful effects on human health and the environment. For example, chlorine and bromine compounds can damage the ozone layer. Fluorine, in high concentrations, is toxic.</p>
